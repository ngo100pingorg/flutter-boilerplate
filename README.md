We wanted to write code which can be use repeatedly with little or no modification, which provides all the basic functionality that programmer needs when building an application. And Programmer does not need to write a lot of code to accomplish simple and basic tasks. Example: using a console library to log info, warning, dangers and etc.

We wish, programmers can reuse code between projects without changing it. Programmers can also keep their own reference libraries on hand. We wish to write well-written boilerplate for flutter. If you think in some areas we can improve or want a new feature, just create a bug on our github repository.

We wish to constantly update a boilerplate that concisely provides valuable information, becomes more efficient, robust, and fairly simple code easy to understand.

The primary advantage of using boilerplate code is that it reduces your initial software development time by reusing basic components. It also reduces complexity in your code, which may result in cleaner code. `If your product is built on boilerplate code, there will be no learning curve for new programmers who have previously worked with boilerplate code thus we suggest let your programmers go through the code and documentation of boilerplate`.
