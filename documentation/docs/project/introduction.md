# Introduction

## Why This Project?

We wanted to write code that programmers can repeatedly use with little or no modification, providing all the basic functionality that programmers need when building an application. And programmer does not need to write much code to accomplish simple and basic tasks. Example: using a console library to log info, warning, dangers, etc. Programmers can also keep their reference libraries on hand. We want to write a well-written boilerplate for flutter.

::: tip Help us
If you think, in some areas, we can improve or you want a new feature, create an issue on our GitHub repository.
:::

The primary advantage of boilerplate code is that it reduces your initial software development time by reusing essential components. It also reduces the complexity of your code, which may result in cleaner code. If your product is built on boilerplate code, there will be no learning curve for new programmers who have previously worked with boilerplate code; thus, we suggest letting your programmers go through the code and documentation of boilerplates.

::: warning Join our team
We wish to update this boilerplate that concisely provides valuable information constantly and becomes more efficient, robust, and reasonably simple code that is easy to understand. If ayone wants to join the team, create an issue on our GitHub repository.
